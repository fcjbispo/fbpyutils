# Active Context

This document captures the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and project insights. It serves as a dynamic record of the ongoing development process.

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on planning and preparing for the `v1.6.3` release of the `fbpyutils` project. A detailed release plan (`PLAN_001_RELEASE_V1.6.3.md`) has been created, outlining the steps for improving test coverage, integrating the global logging system, and refining module imports.

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Initialization:** All core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been initialized and populated with detailed information derived from the project's `README.md` and `DOC.md` files.
- **Version Checkpoint:** The project status is being set to version `v1.6.2` as an initial checkpoint for future implementations.

## Next Steps
- Implement the tasks outlined in `PLAN_001_RELEASE_V1.6.3.md`, starting with improving test coverage for `ofx` and `xlsx` modules.
- Ensure the global logging system (`fbpyutils.logging`) is configurable by external clients' `Env` classes.
- Integrate the global logging system into all specified modules.
- Refactor and move the legacy `Logger` class into `fbpyutils.logging`.
- Create a `SPEC.md` file to formally define specifications.
- Consider adding modules to `__init__.py` for easier import.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Memory Bank as Single Source of Truth:** Reinforcing the principle that the Memory Bank is the primary source of project information for AI agents, ensuring its accuracy and completeness is paramount.
- **Granularity of Documentation:** Deciding on the appropriate level of detail for each memory bank file to provide sufficient context without becoming overly verbose.
- **Automated Memory Bank Updates:** Considering future mechanisms for automated or semi-automated updates to the Memory Bank based on code changes or task completions.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Modular Design:** Continued adherence to the modular structure of `fbpyutils`, with clear separation of concerns for each utility module.
- **Type Hinting:** Consistent use of type hints for improved code clarity and maintainability.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Maintaining a strong emphasis on writing thorough unit tests with high code coverage.
- **Centralized Logging:** Utilizing the `fbpyutils.logging` system for all logging needs across the library.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The existing `README.md` and `DOC.md` files provide a solid foundation for extracting project context, but the Memory Bank structure allows for a more organized and AI-consumable format.
- The process of populating the Memory Bank highlights areas where documentation might be sparse or could be improved for clarity.

## Open Questions / To Be Determined (TBD)
- How frequently should the Memory Bank be explicitly updated by AI agents or through automated processes?
- What is the best strategy for handling discrepancies between code, documentation, and the Memory Bank?
