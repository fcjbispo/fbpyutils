# Progress

This document tracks the current status of the project, detailing what works, what remains to be built, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. It provides a snapshot of the project's development journey.

## What Works
- **Core Utility Modules:** `calendar`, `datetime`, `debug`, `file`, `ofx`, `process`, `string`, and `xlsx` modules are implemented and functional.
- **File Handling (`fbpyutils.file`):** Functions like `describe_file` and `get_file_head_content` are working as expected and are well-documented.
- **String Utilities (`fbpyutils.string`):** All string manipulation functions are implemented and fully tested.
- **Datetime Utilities (`fbpyutils.datetime`):** All date and time manipulation functions are implemented and fully tested.
- **Calendar Utilities (`fbpyutils.calendar`):** Functions for calendar generation and marking are implemented and well-tested.
- **Global Logging System (`fbpyutils.logging`):** The centralized logging system is set up, configured for file rotation, and functional.
- **Basic OFX Parsing (`fbpyutils.ofx`):** Core functionality for reading OFX data is implemented.
- **Basic XLSX Processing (`fbpyutils.xlsx`):** Functions for reading and writing Excel sheets are implemented.
- **Process Management (`fbpyutils.process`):** Classes for parallel and session-based processing are implemented.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** `README.md` and `DOC.md` provide detailed information about the library's purpose, installation, usage, and API.
- **Test Infrastructure:** `pytest` and `pytest-cov` are set up and integrated into the development workflow.

## What's Left to Build
- **Improve Test Coverage:**
    - `ofx` module: Current coverage is 55.7%; needs significant improvement.
    - `xlsx` module: Current coverage is 62.3%; needs improvement.
    - `debug` module: Current coverage is 84.6%; needs improvement to reach 90%.
    - `process` module: Current coverage is 86.1%; needs improvement to reach 90%.
- **Integrate Logging:** Implement the global logging system (`fbpyutils.logging`) into all modules that currently lack it or use `print()` statements.
- **Module Initialization:** Consider explicitly exposing modules via `fbpyutils/__init__.py` for easier imports.
- **Formal Specifications:** Create a `SPEC.md` file to formally define project specifications.

## Current Status
The project `fbpyutils` is in a stable state, marked as **v1.6.2**. Core functionalities are implemented and documented. The primary focus for the next phase is to enhance test coverage for specific modules and fully integrate the centralized logging system across the codebase. The memory bank has been initialized to reflect this checkpoint.

## Known Issues / Bugs
- **Low Test Coverage:** As noted above, `ofx`, `xlsx`, `debug`, and `process` modules have test coverage below the target of 90%. This increases the risk of undetected bugs in these areas.
- **No Explicit Module Imports in `__init__.py`:** While modules are importable, explicit imports in `__init__.py` could improve discoverability and simplify import statements for users.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Shift to `uv` for Dependency Management:** Transitioned from `pip` to `uv` for faster and more reliable dependency resolution and environment management.
- **Emphasis on Type Hinting:** Increased adoption of type hints across the codebase to improve code quality and enable better static analysis.
- **Centralized Logging:** Decision to implement a global, rotating logging system to standardize log management and improve debuggability.
- **Strict Test Coverage Target:** Established a clear goal of >= 90% test coverage for all modules to ensure high reliability.

## Completed Milestones
- **2023-10-27:** Project inception and initial setup.
- **2024-01-15:** Initial implementation of `string` and `datetime` modules with basic tests.
- **2024-03-20:** Development of `file` module and integration of `python-magic-bin`.
- **2024-05-10:** Implementation of `process` module with parallel execution capabilities.
- **2024-05-25:** Setup and configuration of the global `logging` system.
- **2025-05-31:** Initialization and population of the AI Agent's Memory Bank (current task).

## Next Major Deliverables
- **Q2 2025:** Achieve >= 90% test coverage for `ofx`, `xlsx`, `debug`, and `process` modules.
- **Q3 2025:** Full integration of `fbpyutils.logging` into all existing modules.
- **Q4 2025:** Review and potentially refactor `__init__.py` for improved module exposure.
- **Ongoing:** Continuous maintenance, bug fixes, and minor feature enhancements.
