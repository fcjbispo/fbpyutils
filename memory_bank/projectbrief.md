# Project Brief

This document outlines the core requirements and goals of the project. It serves as the foundational document for the AI Software Agent's Memory Bank, defining the project's scope and primary objectives.

## Project Name
fbpyutils - Francisco Bispo's Utilities for Python

## Project Goal
To provide a comprehensive collection of Python utility functions for various common tasks, promoting code reusability, efficiency, and maintainability across different projects.

## Key Requirements
- Offer a wide range of utility functions (string, datetime, file, Excel, OFX, process management).
- Ensure high code quality, efficiency, and maintainability.
- Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for all modules and functions.
- Maintain high test coverage (>= 90%) for all implemented features.
- Support different operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux/macOS) where applicable.
- Implement a robust and configurable logging system.

## Target Audience
Python developers, data engineers, and anyone needing reliable and efficient utility functions for common programming tasks.

## Success Metrics
- High adoption rate within internal projects.
- Positive feedback on utility, ease of use, and documentation.
- Consistent achievement of >= 90% test coverage for all modules.
- Minimal bug reports and high stability.
- Regular updates and feature enhancements based on user needs.

## Constraints and Limitations
- Primarily focused on Python utilities; not a full-fledged framework.
- Dependencies on external libraries (e.g., pandas, ofxparse, openpyxl) must be managed.
- Performance considerations for large-scale data processing.

## Initial Scope
- Core utility modules: string, datetime, file, calendar, debug, ofx, process, xlsx.
- Comprehensive documentation (`DOC.md`, `README.md`).
- Robust testing suite with high coverage.
- Global logging system.

## Out of Scope
- Full-stack application development.
- Domain-specific business logic unrelated to general utilities.
- Complex UI/UX components.

## Stakeholders
- Francisco C J Bispo (Maintainer, Lead Developer)
- Developers using `fbpyutils` in their projects.
